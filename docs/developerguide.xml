    &#9;&#9;<title>Interested in Adding A Feature</title>
    &#9;&#9;<p>If you are interested in adding a feature to Log4Delphi, first discuss it on the developer mailing list. This is to prevent people from doing work which might not be used, either because someone is already working on that feature or because it is not in line with the general direction of the project.</p>
